## Repository structure: <a name = "repository-structure"></a>
Under the `Prelims` and `Finals` folder you can find subfolders containing the details of each problem. Each folder consists of:
 - Problem Statement: `Question.md`
 - Solutions: `Solution.py`, `Solution.cpp`
 - Test inputs: `input/inputxx.txt`
 - Test outputs: `output/outputxx.txt`
 - Subtask distribution: `Subtasks.txt`
 - Test data generator: `Generator.py`

To generate more test data, run the `TestDataGenerator.py` script using the `python TestDataGenerator.py` command and input the relative problem folder path (e.g. `Prelims/Problem1`). Edit the `Subtasks.txt` file in the folder to generate more data of different subtasks.
