# Problem 1
## Problem Statement
Doreamon and Nobita use Doreamon's 4D pocket to teleport to another dimension. But in this dimension, everything is inverted! <br/>
Make a code to read the words of a string backwards, to help them unravel the secrets of this universe!

## Sample Intput
``` "nomaeroD dna atiboN era yllaer dab !syob" ```

## Sample Ouput
``` "Doreamon and Nobita are really bad boys!" ```

## Hint
Make a code that only takes a word (and symbols, if any), inverts it, and puts it in a new string
