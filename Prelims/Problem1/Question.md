# Problem 1
## Problem Statement: <br>
Ram is a very exceptional student. While all other students were using even numbers to play a game of odd or eve, Ram was using these numbers to build an imaginary triangle of them.  

You can imagine the triangle something like this:
```
        0
       2 4
      6 8 10
    12 14 16 18
   20 22 24 26 28
```
and so on infinitely.  

Now Ram wants to take his thinking to the next level.
He asks one of his classmates to give him a number, *N*, and Ram will find the sum of all the numbers in the *N*th row. How Interesting!
But his friend gives him a very large number, which Ram cannot solve.
Can you help Ram solve this problem?

## Sample Input:<br>
```
4
```

## Sample Output:<br>
```
60
```

## Explanation:
The 4th row of the triangle is `12 14 16 18`. Sum of all the numbers in the 4th row is 12+14+16+18 = 60. Hence, 60 is the output.
