# Problem 1
## Problem Statement: <br>
Ram is a very exceptional student. While all other students were using even numbers to play a game of odd or eve, Ram was using these numbers to build an imaginary triangle of them. 
Now Ram wants to take his thinking to the next level.
He asks one of his classmates to give him a number, N, and ram will find the sum of all the numbers in the Nth row. How Interesting!
But his friend gives him a very large number, which ram cannot solve
Can you help ram solve this problem? You can imagine the triangle something like this:
```
        0
       2 4
      6 8 10
    12 14 16 18
   20 22 24 26 28
```
and so on

## Sample Input:<br>
```
4
```

## Sample Output:<br>
```
60
```
